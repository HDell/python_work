Python order of operations follows PEMDAS (precedence).

If there are two operations that have the same level, the order of operations will move from left to right.

Two exponentiations in a row moves from right to left.

TO-DO: Write the c2f.py program yourself. (Simple conversion programs.)

Single alternative if-statement:
	if <condition>:
	... <do_task> #task will run if condition evals to TRUE and will not run if it evals to FALSE

Style note: Don't ever use the tab key to indent in Python (use spaces)
